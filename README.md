#Classifying fake news using passive aggressive classifier.
#The Passive-Aggressive Classifier is a type of online learning algorithm used for large-scale learning tasks. It is particularly useful for tasks where the data is #continuously generated, such as in real-time applications. This classifier belongs to a family of algorithms called large margin classifiers,
#The Passive-Aggressive algorithm can be explained through the lens of margin-based learning. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:
