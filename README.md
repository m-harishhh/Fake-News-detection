#Classifying fake news using passive aggressive classifier.
#The Passive-Aggressive Classifier is a type of online learning algorithm used for large-scale learning tasks. It is particularly useful for tasks where the data is continuously generated, such as in real-time applications. This classifier belongs to a family of algorithms called large margin classifiers,
#The Passive-Aggressive algorithm can be explained through the lens of margin-based learning. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

Initialization:

Start with an initial weight vector 
𝑤
=
0
w=0.
Prediction:

For a given instance 
𝑥
x, the prediction is made using the sign of the dot product 
𝑤
⋅
𝑥
w⋅x:
𝑦
^
=
sign
(
𝑤
⋅
𝑥
)
y
^
​
 =sign(w⋅x)
Loss Function:

The algorithm uses a hinge loss function, which is common in margin-based classifiers. For a labeled instance 
(
𝑥
𝑖
,
𝑦
𝑖
)
(x 
i
​
 ,y 
i
​
 ), where 
𝑦
𝑖
∈
{
−
1
,
1
}
y 
i
​
 ∈{−1,1}, the hinge loss is defined as:
𝐿
(
𝑤
;
𝑥
𝑖
,
𝑦
𝑖
)
=
max
⁡
(
0
,
1
−
𝑦
𝑖
(
𝑤
⋅
𝑥
𝑖
)
)
L(w;x 
i
​
 ,y 
i
​
 )=max(0,1−y 
i
​
 (w⋅x 
i
​
 ))
Update Rule:

If the prediction is correct and the margin 
𝑦
𝑖
(
𝑤
⋅
𝑥
𝑖
)
y 
i
​
 (w⋅x 
i
​
 ) is greater than 1, no update is made (passive part).
If the prediction is incorrect or the margin is less than or equal to 1, the weights are updated (aggressive part).
The update rule aims to find the smallest change to 
𝑤
w that corrects the misclassification or improves the margin. This is achieved by solving the following optimization problem:
𝑤
←
𝑤
+
𝜏
𝑦
𝑖
𝑥
𝑖
w←w+τy 
i
​
 x 
i
​
 
where 
𝜏
τ is the step size defined as:
𝜏
=
𝐿
(
𝑤
;
𝑥
𝑖
,
𝑦
𝑖
)
∥
𝑥
𝑖
∥
2
τ= 
∥x 
i
​
 ∥ 
2
 
L(w;x 
i
​
 ,y 
i
​
 )
​
 
Step Size:

The step size 
𝜏
τ determines how much to adjust the weight vector 
𝑤
w. It ensures that the update is as minimal as possible while correcting the error or improving the margin.
